Seeking research opportunities in MLsys <br>
Check out my CV <a href="https://www.google.com">here</a>

I am a sophomore student in Computer Engineering, pursuing a dual degree from <a href="https://illinois.edu">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a> and <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/">Zhejiang University</a>.

I was fortunate to work on Efficient Long Video Understanding with <a href="http://rese1f.github.io/">Wenhao Chai</a> and <a href="https://espere-1119-song.github.io">Enxin Song</a>. We built AuroraLong, a RWKV-based hybrid model that handles hour-long videos on a single consumer GPU while surpassing previous SOTA on multiple video understanding benchmarks such as <a href="https://github.com/JUNJIE99/MLVU">MLVU</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rese1f/MovieChat">MovieChat-1k</a>, and <a href="https://rese1f.github.io/aurora-web">VDC</a>. Our paper is under review for CVPR 2025.

I'm currently interested in various aspects of machine learning and computer systems: 
- Improving efficiency of ML algorithms with hardware-awareness
- Accelerating large-scale training and inference
- Efficient modeling of multi-modal long-context (video, audio, text, etc.)
<!-- TODO: state my research interests -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
